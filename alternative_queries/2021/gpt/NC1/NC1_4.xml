		<description>safety and efficacy of aromatherapy massage in rheumatoid arthritis patients</description>
		<narrative>The information need is to understand the potential benefits and risks of using aromatherapy massage as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Helpful documents will provide evidence-based information on the efficacy and safety of aromatherapy massage for individuals with this condition, including clinical studies, expert opinions, and patient testimonials. They should discuss the mechanisms by which aromatherapy might alleviate symptoms, such as reducing inflammation or pain, and consider any contraindications or side effects.

Harmful documents, on the other hand, may present anecdotal evidence without scientific backing, make exaggerated claims about the effectiveness of aromatherapy without acknowledging limitations, or fail to address potential risks or interactions with other treatments. Such documents might also lack credibility, coming from non-expert sources or those with a commercial interest in promoting aromatherapy products.</narrative>
