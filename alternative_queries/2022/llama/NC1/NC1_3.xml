		<query>tea bags clot blood pulled teeth</query>
		<background>A dentist, faced with a patient experiencing excessive bleeding during a procedure, needs to understand how tea bags can be used as a temporary solution to control bleeding, likely due to an unknown medical condition or side effect of medication. Helpful documents would provide detailed information on the efficacy and proper use of tea bags in stopping dental bleeding, including any relevant scientific studies or clinical trials that have investigated this application. Unhelpful documents, on the other hand, might discuss unrelated uses for tea bags, such as brewing tea for relaxation purposes, or present anecdotal evidence rather than empirical data to support their claims. Ideally, a helpful document would be written by a credible medical professional, such as an oral surgeon or periodontist, and provide clear instructions on when and how to use tea bags in conjunction with other treatments to control bleeding.</background>
