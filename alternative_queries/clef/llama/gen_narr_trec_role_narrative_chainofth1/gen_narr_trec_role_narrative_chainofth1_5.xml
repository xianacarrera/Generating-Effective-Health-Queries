		<narrative>The patient, a young female, presents with a concerning symptom of constant chest pain, which requires timely identification of potential causes to guide further management. The chest x-ray result is normal, but the radiating pain to the right arm suggests that additional diagnostic information may be needed to rule out cardiac or musculoskeletal causes. A helpful document would likely provide evidence-based guidance on the differential diagnosis for young females presenting with this symptom combination, such as when to consider further imaging like an electrocardiogram (ECG) or a computed tomography angiogram (CTA), and how to evaluate for conditions like costochondritis or myocardial infarction. A harmful document might be one that dismisses the possibility of cardiac causes in young females with normal chest x-rays, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment; or one that suggests unnecessary procedures based on outdated information, resulting in additional patient harm and increased healthcare costs.</narrative>
