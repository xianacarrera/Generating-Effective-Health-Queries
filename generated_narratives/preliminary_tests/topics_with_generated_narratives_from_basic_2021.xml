		<description>Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?</description>
		<narrative>The information need revolves around understanding the effectiveness of using an ankle brace as a treatment method for Achilles tendonitis. A helpful document would provide evidence-based information, such as clinical studies or expert opinions from healthcare professionals, detailing how ankle braces may support the healing process of Achilles tendonitis. It would discuss the mechanism by which an ankle brace could alleviate symptoms, improve mobility, or prevent further injury, and might also compare the effectiveness of ankle braces to other treatment options. Additionally, it would address any potential risks or limitations associated with using an ankle brace for this condition. On the other hand, a harmful document might offer anecdotal evidence without scientific backing, make exaggerated claims about the benefits of ankle braces without acknowledging potential downsides, or provide misleading information that could lead to improper self-treatment. Such a document might also fail to consider individual differences in patients' conditions or neglect to advise consulting a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.</narrative>

These documents should present balanced views, discussing both potential benefits and any limitations or risks associated with such treatments. They should be authored by credible sources, such as healthcare professionals or reputable health organizations, and include references to peer-reviewed research. Harmful documents, on the other hand, might offer anecdotal evidence without scientific backing, make exaggerated claims about the effectiveness of antioxidant supplements, or fail to mention possible side effects or contraindications. Such documents might also come from non-credible sources, such as websites with a commercial interest in selling supplements, and lack transparency regarding their information sources.</narrative>
